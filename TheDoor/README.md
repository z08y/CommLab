###### in one sentence this story is about unexpectedly seeing a door in your dream, wanting to see what's inside for once, not being satisfied, craving the encounter again, trying to stop but realizing the hollowness it leaves, and eventually, getting bored of the door itself. 

###### this web adaptation aims to let readers feel the lingering thoughts and anticipation, the slow ache of waiting, the hollowness that follows once the ache is gone, and the eventual boredom, through interactions like the door following the cursor, scrolling to reveal it, hovering to build anticipation, and clicking to experience the anticlimax.
